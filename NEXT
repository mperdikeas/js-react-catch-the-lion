To release the game:
 1. place white band around white pieces
 2. add button upon game end that allows user to play again
 3. make clear whose black and whose white
 4. add help

Good to have:
 1. implement white / black band around pieces (they don't have to be physically the same as their electronic image can change)
 2. implement difficulty levels
 3. show who's moving
 4. ask AI for help
 5. show total thought time
 6. clip move tree whenever a move results in victory
 7. prevent drag n' drop
 8. the model has to be improved to encourage pieces in board
 9. arrows showing what was the last move made
10. use webw workers to maintain clock on the white side as well
