To release the game:
 1. place white band around white pieces
 2. add button upon game end that allows user to play again
 3. add help / how to play
 4. add sound
 5. add resign / new game button

Good to have:
 1. the model has to be improved to encourage pieces in board (sometimes the AI appears to be hoarding pieces
    in the capturebox, there should be a penalty if there are too many of them)
 2. log showing all the moves that were made (requires coordinates)
